Buildbot Development
====================

This chapter is the official repository for the collected wisdom of the
Buildbot hackers.

It contains some sparse documentation of the inner workings of Buildbot, but of
course, the final reference for that is the source itself.

More importantly, this chapter represents the official repository of all
agreed-on patterns for use in Buildbot.  In this case, the source is a
*terrible* reference, because much of it is old and crusty.  But we are
trying to do things the new, better way, and those new, better ways are
described here.
